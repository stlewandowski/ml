Calculating the number of trainable parameters:
How many trainable parameters does a feedforward network have with input shape (64,),
three hidden layers with 16 units each and a final linear layer with 8 units?

each layer move forward (feed-forward) into the other, multiply the next # of params by previous
then for the bias, add all but the first layer's number of neurons together
Neural network, input 64, 3 16 neuron layers, 8 neuron output:
64
16
16
16
8
64*16
16*16
16*16
16*8
16+16+16+8
